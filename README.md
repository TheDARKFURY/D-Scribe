# D-Scribe

D-Scribe is a Decentralised Blog writing platform on Flow.

With the increasing censorship and control over centralized platforms, we need a solution that provides a more secure and transparent platform for publishing content.

This platform will leverage Flow's blockchain technology to ensure decentralization and remove the risk of a single point of failure. This will create a more resilient platform that cannot be easily manipulated or censored by malicious actors.

Privacy and data ownership are also important to us. With a decentralized system, users will have more control over their personal data and content. This reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information.

D-Scribe offers a more secure, transparent, equitable, and accessible platform for content creators, bloggers, and readers.
